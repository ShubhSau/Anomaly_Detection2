    "Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection by influencing the effectiveness, efficiency, and interpretability of anomaly detection models. Here are the main roles of feature selection in the context of anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dimensionality Reduction: In many datasets, there are numerous features or variables, some of which may not contribute significantly to the identification of anomalies. Feature selection helps reduce the dimensionality of the data by selecting the most relevant features, which can improve the efficiency of anomaly detection algorithms and reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Noise Reduction: Feature selection can help eliminate noisy or irrelevant features that may introduce unnecessary complexity and hinder the accurate identification of anomalies. Removing such features can lead to cleaner and more robust anomaly detection models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reducing the Curse of Dimensionality: High-dimensional data can suffer from the curse of dimensionality, where the volume of the data space increases exponentially with the number of dimensions. This can lead to sparsity and difficulties in distance-based anomaly detection methods. Feature selection mitigates this problem by reducing the number of dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Avoiding Leakage: In some cases, including certain features in the model can unintentionally lead to information leakage, where the model uses information that it should not have access to when making predictions. Feature selection can help prevent such leakage by excluding sensitive or irrelevant features."

Several common evaluation metrics are used to measure the performance of these algorithms. Here are some of the most common metrics and how they are computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. True Positives (TP): True positives represent the number of correctly detected anomalies in the dataset. These are the anomalies that the algorithm correctly identified as anomalies.\n",

    "DBSCAN, which stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, is a popular clustering algorithm used in data mining and machine learning. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms like k-means, which require the number of clusters to be specified in advance, DBSCAN can automatically discover clusters of arbitrary shapes and sizes based on the density of data points in the feature space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how DBSCAN works for clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Density-Based Clustering: DBSCAN defines clusters based on the density of data points. It identifies regions in the data space where data points are closely packed together as clusters, and areas with lower data point density as noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Core Points: In DBSCAN, a \"core point\" is a data point that has at least a specified number of data points (MinPts) within a specified radius (Eps). In other words, a core point is a point that has sufficient nearby neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Directly Density-Reachable: Two data points are said to be \"directly density-reachable\" if one can reach the other by moving only through core points within a distance of Eps. In simpler terms, two points are directly density-reachable if they are close enough to each other and share enough nearby neighbors (core points).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Density-Connected: If two data points are directly density-reachable from each other, they are said to be \"density-connected.\" Density-connectedness is an equivalence relation, meaning it is reflexive (a point is density-connected to itself), symmetric (if A is density-connected to B, then B is density-connected to A), and transitive (if A is density-connected to B and B is density-connected to C, then A is density-connected to C).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Clustering Process:\n",
    "   - DBSCAN starts by selecting an arbitrary data point from the dataset.\n",
    "   - It checks if this point is a core point (has MinPts neighbors within Eps). If it is, it starts forming a cluster around this core point.\n",
    "   - It recursively adds all directly density-reachable points to the cluster.\n",
    "   - The process continues until no more density-reachable points can be added to the cluster.\n",
    "   - Once a cluster is completed, DBSCAN selects another unvisited data point and repeats the process until all data points are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Border Points and Noise: Data points that are not core points but are directly density-reachable from a core point are called \"border points.\" Border points are part of the cluster but are not core points themselves. Data points that are neither core points nor directly density-reachable from core points are considered noise.\n"

The choice of Eps influences how DBSCAN identifies clusters and anomalies in the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Large Eps (Bigger Radius):\n",
    "   - When Eps is set to a large value, it allows data points to have a broader neighborhood, leading to larger and more interconnected clusters.\n",
    "   - This can result in an over-fragmentation of the data into many small clusters, making it less sensitive to variations in density.\n",
    "   - Anomalies are more likely to be absorbed into larger clusters, making it harder for DBSCAN to identify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Optimal Eps (Appropriate Radius):\n",

    "   - Core points are data points that have at least \"MinPts\" (a user-defined parameter) neighboring data points within a specified distance \"Eps\" (another user-defined parameter).\n",
